# Deno Slack SDK

This is the SDK for the Deno Runtime of Run on Slack Functions.

## Documentation

Check out the [`./docs`](./docs) directory!

## Contributing

Not much to say here yet, but for now, if you're making changes or reviewing a PR, please manually run tests via the `test` script. It's a bit of a placeholder until we can setup proper CI that supports `deno`.

```bash
>./test
```

This will run the linter, check formatting, attempt a bundle to catch any compiler errors and run any test files.
