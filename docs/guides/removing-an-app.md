# Removing an app

<PaidPlanBanner />

All good things must come to an end. You can `uninstall` your app if you need to remove an app from a workspace, change app permissions, or `delete` the app in its entirety.

## Uninstall an app from your team {#uninstall-app}

Removing an app from a workspace doesn't have to be a permanent decision. Sometimes uninstalling the app to remove it's active presence in channels is sufficient! This option has the added benefit of reinstallation at a later time without recreating the entire app.

To uninstall an app using the CLI, use the `slack uninstall` command. Then, choose the workspace you want to remove the app from:

```bash
slack uninstall -a A123ABC456 -t T123ABC456
```

```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
   App (A123ABC456) will be uninstalled from my-workspace (T123ABC456)
   All triggers, workflows, and functions will be deleted
   Datastore records will be persisted

‚ùì Are you sure you want to uninstall? Yes

üè† Workspace uninstall
   Uninstalled the app "my-app" from workspace "my-workspace"
```

## Delete an app from your team {#delete-app}

:::danger[Deleting your app _permanently_ deletes all of its data]

Your app's related workflows, functions, and datastores will also be deleted. This decision is final and cannot be undone.

:::

To delete an app using the CLI, use the `slack delete` command:

```bash
slack delete -a A123ABC456 -t T123ABC456
```

```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è Danger zone

   Once you delete this app, there is no going back
