## Block kit action handlers

Your application's [functions][functions] can do a wide variety of interesting
things: post messages, create channels, or anything available to developers via
the [Slack API][api]. One of the more compelling features available to app developers
is the ability to use [Block Kit][block-kit] to add richness and depth to messages
in Slack. Even better, [Block Kit][block-kit] supports a variety of [interactive components][interactivity]!
This document explores the APIs available to app developers building Run-On-Slack applications
to leverage these [interactive components][interactivity] and how applications can respond to user interactions
with these [interactive components][interactivity].

If you're already familiar with the main concepts underpinning Block Kit Action Handlers,
then you may want to skip ahead to the [`addBlockActionsHandler()` method API Reference](#api-reference).

### Requirements

Your app needs to have an existing [function][functions] defined, implemented and working
before you can add interactivity handlers like Block Kit Action Handlers to them.
Make sure you have followed our [functions documentation][functions] and have a
function in your app ready that we can expand with a Block Kit Action Handler.

As part of exploring how Block Kit Action Handlers work, we'll walk through an
approval flow example. A user would trigger our app's function, which would post
a message with two buttons: Approve and Deny. Once someone clicks either button,
our app will handle these button interactions - these Block Kit Actions - and
update the original message with either an "Approved!" or "Denied!" text.

For the purposes of walking through this approval flow example, let us assume the
following [function][functions] definition (that we will store in a file called `definition.ts` under the `functions/approval/` subdirectory inside your app):

```typescript
import { DefineFunction, Schema } from "deno-slack-sdk/mod.ts";

export const ApprovalFunction = DefineFunction({
  callback_id: "review_approval",
  title: "Approval",
  description: "Get approval for a request",
  source_file: "functions/approval/mod.ts", // <-- important! Make sure this is where the logic for your function - which we will write in the next section - exists.
  input_parameters: {
    properties: {
      requester_id: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.user_id,
        description: "Requester",
      },
      approval_channel_id: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.channel_id,
        description: "Approval channel",
      },
    },
    required: [
      "requester_id",
      "approval_channel_id",
    ],
  },
  output_parameters: {
    properties: {
      approved: {
        type: Schema.types.boolean,
        description: "Approved",
      },
      reviewer: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.user_id,
        description: "Reviewer",
      },
      message_ts: {
        type: Schema.types.string,
        description: "Request Message TS",
      },
    },
    required: ["approved", "reviewer", "message_ts"],
  },
});
```

### Posting a message with block kit elements

First, we need a message that has some [interactive components][interactivity]
from [Block Kit][block-kit] included! We can modify one of our app's [functions][functions]
to post a message that includes some interactive components. Here's an example function
(which we will assume exists in a `mod.ts` file under the `functions/approval/`
subdirectory in your app) that posts a message with two buttons: an approval button,
and a deny button:

```typescript
import { SlackFunction } from "deno-slack-sdk/mod.ts";
// ApprovalFunction is the function we defined in the previous section
import { ApprovalFunction } from "./definition.ts";

export default SlackFunction(ApprovalFunction, async ({ inputs, client }) => {
  console.log('Incoming approval!');

  await client.chat.postMessage({
    channel: inputs.approval_channel_id,
    blocks: [{
      "type": "actions",
      "block_id": "mah-buttons",
      "elements": [{
        type: "button",
        text: {
          type: "plain_text",
          text: "Approve",
        },
        action_id: "approve_request",
        style: "primary",
      },
      {
        type: "button",
        text: {
          type: "plain_text",
          text: "Deny",
        },
        action_id: "deny_request",
        style: "danger",
      }],
    }],
  });
  // Important to set completed: false! We will set the function's complete
  // status later - in our action handler
  return {
    completed: false,
  };
});
```

The key bit of information we need to remember before moving on to adding an
action handler are the `action_id` and `block_id` properties defined in the `blocks`
payload. Using these IDs, we will be able to differentiate between the different
button components that users interacted with in this message.

### Adding block action handlers

The [Deno Slack SDK][sdk] - which comes bundled in your generated Run-on-Slack
application - provides a means for defining a handler to execute every time a user
interacts with an interactive Block Kit element created by your function.

Continuing with our above example, we can now define a handler that will listen
for actions on one of the interactive components we attached to the message our
main function posted: either the approve button being clicked or the deny button
being clicked. The code to add a Block Kit action handler is "chained" off of your
top-level function, and would look like this:

```typescript
export default SlackFunction(ApprovalFunction, async ({ inputs, client }) => {
  // ... the rest of your ApprovalFunction logic here ...
}).addBlockActionsHandler(
  ['approve_request', 'deny_request'], // The first argument to addBlockActionsHandler can accept an array of action_id strings, among many other formats!
  // Check the API reference at the end of this document for the full list of supported options
  async ({ action, body, client }) => { // The second argument is the handler function itself
    console.log('Incoming action handler invocation', action);

    const outputs = {
      reviewer: body.user.id,
      // Based on which button was pressed - determined via action_id - we can
      // determine whether the request was approved or not.
      approved: action.action_id === "approve_request",
      message_ts: body.message.ts,
    };

    // Remove the button from the original message using the chat.update API
    // and replace its contents with the result of the approval.
    await client.chat.update({
      channel: body.function_data.inputs.approval_channel_id,
      ts: outputs.message_ts,
      blocks: [{
        type: "context",
        elements: [
          {
            type: "mrkdwn",
            text: `${
              outputs.approved ? " :white_check_mark: Approved" : ":x: Denied"
            } by <@${outputs.reviewer}>`,
          },
        ],
      }],
    });

    // And now we can mark the function as 'completed' - which is required as
    // we explicitly marked it as incomplete in the main function handler.
    await client.functions.completeSuccess({
      function_execution_id: body.function_data.execution_id,
      outputs,
    });
  }
);
```

Now when you run your app and trigger your function, you have the basics in place
to provide interactivity between your application and users in Slack!

### API reference

#### `addBlockActionsHandler(constraint, handler)`

```typescript
SlackFunction({ ... }).addBlockActionsHandler({ block_id: "mah-buttons", action_id: "approve_request"}, async (ctx) => { ... });
```

`addHandler` registers a block action handler based on a `constraint` argument.
If any incoming actions match the `constraint`, then the specified `handler` will
be invoked with the action. This allows for authoring focussed, single-purpose
action handlers and provides a concise but flexible API for registering handlers
to specific actions.

`constraint` is of type [`BlockActionConstraint`][constraint], which itself can
be either a [`BlockActionConstraintField`](#blockactionconstraintfield) or a [`BlockActionConstraintObject`](#blockactionconstraintobject).

If a [`BlockActionConstraintField`](#blockactionconstraintfield) is used as the
value for `constraint`, then this will be matched against the incoming action's
`action_id` property.

[`BlockActionConstraintObject`](#blockactionconstraintobject) is a more complex
object used to match against actions. It contains nested `block_id` and `action_id`
properties - both optional - that are used to match against the incoming action.

##### `BlockActionConstraintField`

```typescript
type BlockActionConstraintField = string | string[] | RegExp;
```

- when provided as a `string`, it must match the field exactly.
- when provided as an array of `string`s, it must match one of the array values exactly.
- when provided as a `RegExp`, the regular expression must match.

###### `BlockActionConstraintObject`

```typescript
type BlockActionConstraintObject = {
  block_id?: BlockActionConstraintField;
  action_id?: BlockActionConstraintField;
};
```

This object can contain two properties, both optional: `action_id` and/or `block_id`.
The type of each property is [`BlockActionConstraintField`](#blockactionconstraintfield).

If both `action_id` and `block_id` properties exist on the `constraint`, then both
`action_id` and `block_id` properties _must match_ any incoming action. If only
one of these properties is provided, then only the provided property must match.
