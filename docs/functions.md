## Custom functions

Functions are the core of your Slack app: they accept one or more input
parameters, execute some logic and return one or more output parameters.

Functions can optionally define different kinds of Interactivity Handlers. If
your function creates messages or opens views, then it may need to define one or
more interactivity handlers to respond to user interactions with these
interactive components. Run-on-Slack applications support the following
interactivity handlers, follow the links to get more information about how each
of them work:

- [Block Kit Action Handlers][action-handlers]: Handle events from interactive
  [Block Kit][block-kit] components that you can use in messages like
  [Buttons, Menus and Date/Time Pickers](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/interactivity)
- [View Handlers][view-handlers]: Handle events triggered from [Modals][modals],
  which are composed of [Views][views].
- [Block Kit Suggestion Handlers][suggest-handlers]: Handle events from
  [external-data-sourced Block Kit select menus](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_select)

### Defining a custom function

Functions can be defined with the top level `DefineFunction` export. Below is an
example function that turns a `name` input parameter into a dinosaur name:

```ts
import { DefineFunction, Schema } from "slack-cloud-sdk/mod.ts";

export const DinoFunction = DefineFunction({
  callback_id: "dino",
  title: "Dino",
  description: "Turns a name into a dinosaur name",
  source_file: "functions/dino.ts",
  input_parameters: {
    name: {
      type: Schema.types.string,
      description: "The provided name",
    },
  },
  output_parameters: {
    dinoname: {
      type: Schema.types.string,
      description: "The new dinosaur name",
    },
  },
});
```

Let's go over each of the arguments that must be provided to `DefineFunction`.

#### Function definition

The passed argument is the `definition` of the function, an object with a few
properties that help to describe and define the function in more detail. In
particular, the required properties of the object are:

- `callback_id`: A unique string identifier representing the function (`"dino"`
  in the above example). It must be unique in your application; no other
  functions may be named identically. Changing a function's `callback_id` is not
  recommended as it means that the function will be removed from the app and
  created under the new `callback_id`, which will break any workflows
  referencing the old function.
- `title`: A pretty string to nicely identify the function.
- `description`: A short-and-sweet string description of your function
  succinctly summarizing what your function does.
- `source_file`: The relative path from the project root to the function
  `handler` file.
- `input_parameters`: Itself an object which describes one or more input
  parameters that will be available to your function. Each top-level property of
  this object defines the name of one input parameter which will become
  available to your function. The value for this property needs to be an object
  with further sub-properties:
  - `type`: The type of the input parameter. The supported types are `string`,
    `integer`, `boolean`, `number`, `object` and `array`.
  - `description`: A string description of the input parameter.
- `output_parameters`: Itself an object which describes one or more output
  parameters that will be returned by your function. This object follows the
  exact same pattern as `input_parameters`: top-level properties of the object
  define output parameter names, with the property values being an object that
  further describes the `type` and `description` of individual output
  parameters.

### Adding runtime logic to your custom function

Now that you have defined your function's input and output parameters, it's time
to define the body of your function.

First, create a new file at the location set on the `source_file` parameter of
your function definition. Next, let's add code for your function! You will want
to `export default` an instance of `SlackFunction`, like so:

```typescript
import { SlackFunction } from "deno-slack-sdk/mod.ts";

export default SlackFunction(
  // Pass along the function definition you created earlier using `DefineFunction`
  DinoFunction,
  ({ inputs }) => { // Provide any context properties, like `inputs`, `env`, or `token`
    // Implement your function
    const { name } = inputs;
    const dinoname = `${name}asaurus`;

    // Don't forget any required output parameters
    return { outputs: { dinoname } };
  },
);
```

Key points:

- The function takes a single argument, referred to as the
  [function "context"](#function-handler-context).
- The function [returns an object](#function-return-object).

#### Custom function handler context

The single argument to your function is an object composed of several properties
that may be useful to leverage during your function's execution:

- `env`: represents environment variables available to your function's execution
  context.
- `inputs`: an object containing the input parameters you defined as part of
  your function definition. In the example above, the `name` input parameter is
  available on the `inputs` property of our function handler context.
- `client`: An API client ready for use in your function. An instance of the
  `deno-slack-api` library.
- `token`: your application's access token.
- `team_id`: the encoded team (a.k.a. Slack workspace) ID, i.e. T12345.
- `enterprise_id`: the encoded enterprise ID, i.e. E12345. If the Slack
  workspace the function executes in is not a part of an enterprise grid, then
  this value will be the empty string (`""`).
- `event`: an object containing the full incoming event details.

##### Custom function return object

The object returned by your function that supports the following properties:

- `error`: a string indicating the error that was encountered. If present, the
  function will return an error regardless of what is passed to `outputs`.
- `outputs`: an object that exactly matches the structure of your function
  definition's `output_parameters`. This is required unless an `error` is
  returned.
- `completed`: a boolean indicating whether or not the function is completed.
  This defaults to `true`.

### Adding custom functions to the manifest

Once you have defined a function, don't forget to include it in your
[`Manifest`][manifest] definition!

```ts
import { ReverseString } from "./functions/reverse_definition.ts";

Manifest({
  name: "heuristic-tortoise",
  description: "A demo showing how to use custom functions",
  icon: "assets/icon.png",
  botScopes: ["commands", "chat:write", "chat:write.public"],
  functions: [ReverseString], // <-- don't forget this!
});
```
