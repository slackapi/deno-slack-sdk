# Creating an app

<PaidPlanBanner />

An app goes through stages of development, from creation to experimentation and development to production. Sometimes a [removal](/deno-slack-sdk/guides/removing-an-app) happens too.

The [Slack CLI](/slack-cli) provides a set of commands to make managing these stages a bit easier with the following offerings:

- `slack create` to [create a brand new app](#create-app)
- `slack app link` to [link an existing app to a project](#link-app)

## Verify workspace authentication {#verify}

Before you can create (or remove) an app, ensure your CLI is authenticated into the workspace you want to develop in. You can do so with the `slack auth list` command:

```bash
$ slack auth list

myworkspace (Team ID: T123456789)
User ID: U123456789
Last update: 2022-03-24 18:20:47 -07:00
Authorization Level: Workspace

To change your active workspace authorization run slack login
```

## Create an app {#create-app}

With your CLI authenticated into the workspace you want to develop in, the next step is to scaffold an app with the `slack create` command:

```bash
$ slack create my-app
```
The above command will scaffold a new app called `my-app` in a directory with the same name. If you don't pass an app name, `slack` will scaffold an app with a random alphanumeric name.

You will be presented with three options to build from:
* The introductory [Issue Submission](https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-issue-submission) app
* The scaffolded [Deno Starter Template](https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-starter-template)
* The completely blank [Deno Blank Template](https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-blank-template)

:::tip
If you'd like to build from a specific sample app, see [Create an app from a template](#templates) below.
:::

```bash
? Select a template to build from: [Use arrows to move]

> Issue submission (default sample)
  Basic app that demonstrates an issue submission workflow

  Scaffolded project
  Solid foundation that includes a Slack datastore

  Blank project
  A, well.. blank project

Once you select an option the Slack CLI will get you set up for success.

```bash
$ slack create my-app

🧭 Explore the documentation to learn more
   Read the README.md or peruse the docs over at api.slack.com/automation
   Find available commands and usage info with `slack help`

📋 Follow the steps below to begin development
   Change into your project directory with `cd my-app`
   Develop locally and see changes in real-time with `slack run`
   When you're ready to deploy for production use `slack deploy`
   Create a trigger to invoke your workflows `slack trigger create`
```

After creating an app, don't forget to `cd` into your app project's directory.

➡️ **To keep building your own app**, learn about your app's manifest in the [manifest](/deno-slack-sdk/guides/using-the-app-manifest) section.

### Create an app from a template {#templates}

:::warning[Evaluate third-party apps]

Exercise caution before trusting third-party and open source applications and automations (those outside of [`slack-samples`](https://github.com/slack-samples)). Review all source code created by third-parties before running `slack create` or `slack deploy`. 

:::

We have a [collection of sample apps](https://github.com/slack-samples) containing a bevy of use cases. Find one particularly suited for your needs? Great! You can use it as a template to build from.

Create an app from a template by using the `create` command with the `--template` (or `-t`) flag and passing the link to the template's Github repo.

For example, the following command creates an app using our [Welcome Bot](https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-welcome-bot) app as a template:

```bash
slack create my-welcome-bot-app -t https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-welcome-bot
```

#### Create an app from a specific branch {#branch}

Use a specific branch of a template repo by using the `--branch` (or `-b`) flag and passing the name of a branch:

```bash
slack create my-welcome-bot-app -t https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-welcome-bot -b main
```

---

## Link an app {#link-app}

Apps that were created without the CLI can still be used with the CLI for ease in app management. This requires the `app link` command to save information about the app with the project it exists on:

```bash
slack app link --app A0123456789 --team T0123456789 --environment "deployed"
```

```bash
🏠 An existing app was added to the project
   my-workspace:
      App  ID: A0123456789
      Team ID: T0123456789
      Status:  Installed
```

This command can be used without flags, but the above example would use the app ID "A01234567890" from team "T01234567890" - the team the app was created on - as a "deployed" app. Following selections in commands will reveal this app as an option and it's all set for CLI use!

Another `--environment` option is "local" and this saves apps to `.slack/apps.dev.json`. Local apps are intended for personal development and experimentation while "deployed" apps - saved to `.slack/apps.json` - serve the needs of production.

Just one app ID can exist for each combination of team ID and environment to avoid accidental selections with duplicated possibilities. The provided app ID must also exist for this `link` command to complete with success.

## Onward

Your wish is our command! For information about other actions you can perform from the CLI, refer to the [Slack CLI commands guide](/slack-cli/guides/running-slack-cli-commands).

Check out more about how to configure your app via the [manifest](/deno-slack-sdk/guides/using-the-app-manifest). You can also start building [functions](/deno-slack-sdk/guides/creating-slack-functions) to perform some logic, chain them together in [workflows](/deno-slack-sdk/guides/creating-workflows), and create [triggers](/deno-slack-sdk/guides/using-triggers) to invoke those workflows.
